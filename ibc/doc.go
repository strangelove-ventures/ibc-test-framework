// Package ibc provides chain and relayer agnostic types and interfaces for the IBC spec.
// It attempts to expose the domain model of IBC.
//
// The official spec documentation can be found at https://github.com/cosmos/ibc/tree/master/spec.
//
// Currently, the interfaces may be biased towards chains built with the cosmos sdk and the cosmos/relayer.
