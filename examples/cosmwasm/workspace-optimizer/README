The rust-optimizer example contains a simple contract that performs minimal functionality.
The single contract uses cosmwasm/rust-optimizer to compile during test execution.
The test case shows how the contract source can integrate with interchaintest: building the contract, spinning up a chain, storing it on-chain, and instantiating/querying/executing against it.
