The workspace-optimizer example contains a workspace organized with two simple contracts that performs minimal functionality.
The workspace uses cosmwasm/workspace-optimizer to compile during test execution.
The test case shows how the contracts source can integrate with interchaintest: building the contracts, spinning up a chain, storing it on-chain, and instantiating/querying/executing against it.
