## Building Binary

While it is not necessary to build the binary, sometimes it can be more convenient, *specifically* when running conformance test with custom chain sets.

Building binary:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/strangelove-ventures/interchaintest.git
cd interchaintest
make interchaintest
```

This places the binary in `interchaintest/bin/interchaintest`

Note that this is not in your Go path.
