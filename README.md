ðŸŒŒ Why use `interchaintest`?
=============================

In order to ship production-grade software for the Interchain, we needed sophisticated developer tooling...but IBC and Web3 have a *lot* of moving parts, which can lead to a steep learning curve and all sorts of pain. Recognize any of these?

- repeatedly building repo-specific, Docker- and shell-based testing solutions,
- duplication of effort, and
- difficulty in repurposing existing testing harnesses for new problem domains.

We built `interchaintest` to extract patterns and create a generic test harness: a use-case-agnostic framework for generating repeatable, diagnostic tests for every aspect of IBC.

ðŸŒŒðŸŒŒ Who benefits from `interchaintest`?
=============================

`interchaintest` is for developers who expect top-shelf testing tools when working on blockchain protocols such as Cosmos or Ethereum.


ðŸŒŒðŸŒŒðŸŒŒ What does `interchaintest` do?
=============================

`interchaintest` is a framework for testing blockchain functionality and interoperability between chains, primarily with the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol.

Want to quickly spin up custom testnets and dev environments to test IBC, [Relayer](https://github.com/cosmos/relayer) setup, chain infrastructure, smart contracts, etc.? `interchaintest` orchestrates Go tests that utilize Docker containers for multiple [IBC](https://www.ibcprotocol.dev/)-compatible blockchains.



ðŸŒŒðŸŒŒðŸŒŒðŸŒŒ How do I use it?
=============================

## As a Module

Most people choose to import `interchaintest` as a module.
- Often, teams will [integrate `interchaintest` with a github CI/CD pipeline](./docs/ciTests.md).
- Most teams will write their own suite. Here's a tutorial on [Writing Custom Tests](./docs/writeCustomTests.md).
- You can also [utilize our suite of built-in Conformance Tests that exercise high-level IBC compatibility](./docs/conformance-tests-lib.md).

## As a Binary

There's also an option to [build and run `interchaintest` as a binary](./docs/buildBinary.md) (which might be preferable, e.g., with custom chain sets). You can still [run Conformance Tests](./docs/conformance-tests-bin.md).

### Deprecated Branches

These are branches that we no longer actively update or maintain but may be of use if a chain is running older versions of the `Cosmos SDK ` or `IBC Go`. Please see the [Backport Policy](#backport-policy) below.

#### Backport Policy:
Strangelove maintains `n` and `n - 1` branches of `interchaintest`, `n` being current `main`.

We strive to keep `interchaintest` inline with the latest from the ibc-go and cosmos sdk teams. Once an alpha versions of the next major ibc-go version is released, we will discontinue `n - 1` and branch off a new `n`.

**Recommendation:** Even if your chain uses an older version of ibc-go, try importing from `main`. This should work unless you are decoding transactions that require a specific ibc-go version.

If there is a feature you would like backported to an older branch, make an issue! We are happy to work with you.
