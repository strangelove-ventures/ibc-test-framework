`interchaintest` orchestrates Go tests that utilize Docker containers for multiple
[IBC](https://docs.cosmos.network/master/ibc/overview.html)-compatible blockchains.

It allows users to quickly spin up custom testnets and dev environments to test IBC, chain infrastructures, smart contracts, etc.

### -- Features --

- Built-in suite of conformance tests to test high-level IBC compatibility between chain sets
- Easily construct customized tests in highly configurable environments
- Deployable as CI tests in production workflows

## Building Binary

While it is not necessary to build the binary, sometimes it can be more convenient, *specifically* when running conformance test with custom chain sets. 

Building binary:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/strangelove-ventures/interchaintest.git
cd interchaintest
make interchaintest
```

This places the binary in `interchaintest/.bin/interchaintest`

Note that this is not in your Go path.
